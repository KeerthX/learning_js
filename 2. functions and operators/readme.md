# Functions and Operators 

Functions are basically **Reusable Code** <br>

```
function numValue(){
    return 10
}
```
When the function **numValue()** is called anywhere else in the program <br>
will give the value 10

```
const value = numValue();
```
Now the variable value has the number 10 stored in it 

This value could also be strings, characters, and boolean values

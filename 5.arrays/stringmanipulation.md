# String Manipulation

## Index 

In JavaScript the index of characters in a string starts from 0. This is known as **Zero-Based Indexing**

## Extracting Characters from a String

To extract a character from a string there are two ways 

1. Using the **charAt** function

**Syntax**
```
string.charAt(index);
```

2. Using **[]** 

**Syntax**
```
string.[index];
```

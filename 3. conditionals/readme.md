# Conditionals

## Conditional Operators
**===** operator is called as strict equality
It compares two calues and outputs true if they are  *equal*

**!==** operator is called as strict inequality
It compares two calues and outputs false if they are  *equal*

**<** operator is called the less than sign

**>** operator is called the greater than sign

These two operators give outputs depending on the condition as either true or false.<br>
But if the compared values are both **equal** then it outputs **False**

**<=** operator is called the less than or equal to sign

**>=** operator is called the greater than or equal to sign

## if Statement

In this conditional the if statement returns a value depending on the conditions given to it.

**Syntax:**
```
if(condition){
    statement
}
```

## if-else Statement

In this type of conditional the else statement runs only if <br>
the if statement is **flase**

**Syntax**
```
if(condition){
    statement 1;
}
else{
    statement 2;
}
```
## if-elseif ladder Statement

In this type of conditional we are comparing or checking for multiple conditions

**Syntax**
```
if(condition 1){
    statement 1;
}
else if(condition 2){
    statement 2;
}
.....
else if(condition n){
    statement n;
}
else{
    statement n+1;
}
```
